# Data Warehousing: Detailed End-Term Notes

## Introduction to Data Warehousing

Data warehousing involves collecting and managing data from different sources within an organization to support decision-making. Unlike operational databases designed for day-to-day transactions, data warehouses are optimized for analysis and reporting. They store large amounts of historical data, enabling organizations to analyze trends over time.

**Features of Data Warehousing:**

- **Subject-Oriented:** Focuses on specific areas like sales, customer, or finance, providing a clear view of particular business aspects.
- **Integrated:** Combines data from various sources, which often have different formats and naming conventions, into a consistent format.
- **Non-Volatile:** Once data enters the warehouse, it is not changed or deleted frequently, ensuring data stability for historical analysis.
- **Time-Variant:** Maintains historical data over different periods, allowing analysis of changes over time.

## Difference Between a Database System and a Data Warehouse

Table

|Aspect|Database System|Data Warehouse|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary Purpose**|Managing everyday transactional data (OLTP)|Supporting decision-making, analysis (OLAP)|
|**Data Types**|Current data (e.g., today’s sales)|Historical data (e.g., sales over the past year)|
|**Schema Design**|Normalized for fast transactions|Denormalized for query efficiency|
|**Performance Optimization**|Speedy for insert/update/delete|Optimized for complex queries and reads|
|**Updates**|Frequent, 24/7|Periodic batch updates (e.g., nightly)|

_Explanation:_ Regular databases are designed to process individual transactions quickly. Data warehouses, in contrast, are designed to handle complex queries across large datasets, supporting trend analysis, forecasting, and strategic decision-making.

## The Compelling Need for Data Warehousing

- **Data Integration:** Companies operate multiple systems (sales, finance, HR). A warehouse integrates data from these diverse sources, providing a unified view.
- **Historical Data Storage:** Operational systems often retain only recent data; warehouses store historical data over years.
- **Enhanced Business Intelligence:** Enables complex querying, data mining, and reporting to extract insights.
- **Performance Separation:** Offloads analytical queries from transactional systems to improve performance.
- **Informed Decision Making:** Provides managers with timely, accurate, and comprehensive data.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensures comparable, cleaned data across sources, reducing discrepancies.

## Building Blocks of Data Warehouses

- **Data Sources:** Operational databases, external data (market data, social media).
- **ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):** Handles data extraction, cleans data, transforms it into the warehouse’s schema, and loads it into the storage. This step is critical for data quality and consistency.
- **Data Warehouse Storage:** The core repository, often relational or multidimensional, optimized for read-heavy operations.
- **Metadata:** Information describing data’s origin, structure, transformations, and usage. It helps users understand the data.
- **Query and Reporting Tools:** Front-end applications used by end-users to perform analysis, generate reports, and visualize data.

## Features of Data Warehouses

- **Subject-Oriented:** Designed around key business subjects rather than daily operations.
- **Integrated:** Data from multiple sources is cleaned, transformed, and integrated.
- **Time-Variant:** Supports historical data, enabling temporal analysis like year-over-year comparisons.
- **Non-Volatile:** Data is stable once stored; updates happen in batch periods.
- **Accessible:** Easy for users to query and analyze data via BI tools.

## Data Warehouses vs. Data Marts

- **Data Warehouse:** Contains all organizational data, designed for enterprise-wide analysis.
- **Data Marts:** Smaller, focused data subsets designed for specific departments or functions (e.g., sales, marketing). Data marts are faster and easier to manage for departmental analysis but are derived from the larger warehouse, ensuring consistency.

## Components of a Data Warehouse

- **Data Sources:** Various operational and external sources feeding data into the system.
- **ETL Layer:** Processes that extract data, clean and transform it, and load it into the warehouse.
- **Storage Layer:** Central repository where cleaned, integrated data is stored.
- **Metadata Repository:** Stores metadata for describing data structure, lineage, and transformations.
- **Access and Analysis Layer:** Tools and interfaces through which users run queries, generate reports, and perform data analysis.

## Three-Tier Architecture of Data Warehouse

1. **Bottom Tier:** The data source layer, consisting of operational databases and external data feeds.
2. **Middle Tier:** The core data warehouse system, including ETL processes, data storage, and metadata.
3. **Top Tier:** User interface layer—querying, reporting, analysis tools like OLAP cubes, dashboards, and data mining tools.

This architecture helps in managing data efficiently, separating data storage from user access and analysis, thus improving performance.

## Metadata in Data Warehousing

Metadata is the descriptive layer about data stored in a warehouse. It helps users and administrators understand the data's structure, origins, transformations, and usage.

**Types of Metadata:**

- **Structural Metadata:** Schema details like table structures, columns, data types.
- **Descriptive Metadata:** Definitions, data quality information, and data lineage.
- **Operational Metadata:** Logs of data processing, error reports, and refresh schedules.

**Importance:**  
Metadata simplifies data management, improves query efficiency, ensures data governance, and helps users navigate large datasets effectively.
