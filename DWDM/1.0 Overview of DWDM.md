- It is large centralized repository that stores large volume of structured and sometimes unstructured data from various sources
- It is designed for query and analysis rather than transaction processing
- Data from different operational systems like CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is extracted, transformed and loaded (ETL {Extract, Transform, Load}) into data warehouse for business intelligence (BI) purpose.


- **ETL** – **Extract, Transform, Load**
    
    > A data integration process that involves extracting data from different sources, transforming it into a suitable format or structure for analysis, and loading it into a data warehouse or other destination system.
