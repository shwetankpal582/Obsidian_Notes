A **Deep Belief Network (DBN)** is a type of **deep generative neural network** that is made by stacking multiple **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)** on top of each other.

- It **learns a hierarchical representation** of the input data.
    
- DBNs can be used for **feature extraction**, **dimensionality reduction**, or **pretraining deep networks**.

### ðŸ”¹ Components of a DBN

1. **Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)**:
    
    - A shallow, two-layer neural network.
        
    - Consists of:
        
        - **Visible layer** (input features)
            
        - **Hidden layer** (learned features)
            
    - Learns **probabilities** of input patterns.
        
2. **Stacked RBMs**:
    
    - In a DBN, the **output of one RBM is the input to the next**.
        
    - Each layer learns more **abstract and higher-level features**.

### ðŸ”¹ Training Process of a DBN

**Two Steps**:

1. **Unsupervised Pretraining** (Layer-by-layer):
    
    - Each RBM is trained **independently** using **unsupervised learning** (Contrastive Divergence).
        
    - The first RBM is trained on the raw data.
        
    - Each subsequent RBM is trained on the **activations** from the previous RBM.
        
2. **Fine-Tuning** (Optional Supervised Training):
    
    - After pretraining, the whole network can be **fine-tuned using backpropagation** if labels are available (for classification tasks).

### ðŸ”¹ Difference Between DBN and Traditional Feedforward Neural Network

|Feature|Deep Belief Network (DBN)|Feedforward Neural Network|
|---|---|---|
|Training|Layer-wise unsupervised + fine-tuning|End-to-end supervised|
|Type|Generative (can generate data)|Discriminative (for prediction)|
|Pretraining|Yes (RBMs)|No|
|Complexity|More complex training|Simpler training|

### ðŸ”¹ Applications of DBNs

- **Handwriting recognition** (e.g., MNIST digits)
    
- **Dimensionality reduction**
    
- **Anomaly detection**
    
- **Pretraining deep networks**

### ðŸ”¹ Summary

> A **Deep Belief Network** is a deep generative model made by stacking **Restricted Boltzmann Machines**. It is trained layer-wise in an unsupervised way, then fine-tuned with supervision for tasks like classification. DBNs are useful for **unsupervised pretraining and feature learning**.
