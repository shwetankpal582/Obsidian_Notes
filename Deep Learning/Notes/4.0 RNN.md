## Recurrent Neural Network

In neural network the information flows in one direction from input to output. However in RNN information is fed back into the system after each step. 

RNNs allow the network to "remember" past information by feeding the output from one step into next step. This helps the network understand the context of what has already happened and make better predictions based on that. 

For example 
	when predicting the next word in a sentence the RNN uses the previous words to help decide what word is most likely to come next.
	Think of it like reading a sentence, when you're trying to predict the next word you don’t just look at the current word but also need to remember the words that came before to make accurate guess.

## How RNN Differs from Feedforward Neural Networks?

Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) 
	process data in one direction from input to output without retaining information from previous inputs. This makes them suitable for tasks with independent inputs like image classification. However FNNs struggle with sequential data since they lack memory.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 
	solve this by incorporating loops that allow information from previous steps to be fed back into the network. This feedback enables RNNs to remember prior inputs making them ideal for tasks where context is important

## Key Components of RNN

- ### Recurrent Neurons
- ### RNN Unfolding

### 1. Recurrent Neurons
Recurrent units hold a hidden state that maintains information about previous inputs in a sequence. Recurrent units can "remember" information from prior steps by feeding back their hidden state, allowing them to capture dependencies across time.

### 2. RNN Unfolding

the process of expanding the recurrent structure over time steps. During unfolding each step of the sequence is represented as a separate layer in a series illustrating how information flows across each time step.

This unrolling enables backpropagation through time (BPTT). A learning process where errors are propagated across time steps to adjust the network’s weights enhancing the RNN’s ability to learn dependencies within sequential data.

## Types Of Recurrent Neural Networks

- ### One-to-One RNN
- ### One-to-Many RNN
- ### Many-to-One RNN
- ### Many-to-Many RNN

### 1. One-to-One RNN
This is the simplest type of neural network architecture where there is a single input and a single output. It is used for straightforward classification tasks such as binary classification where no sequential data is involved.

### 2. One-to-Many RNN
RNN the network processes a single input to produce multiple outputs over time. This is useful in tasks where one input triggers a sequence of predictions (outputs). 
	For example in image captioning a single image can be used as input to generate a sequence of words as a caption.

### 3. Many-to-One RNN
The Many-to-One RNN receives a sequence of inputs and generates a single output. This type is useful when the overall context of the input sequence is needed to make one prediction. In sentiment analysis the model receives a sequence of words (like a sentence) and produces a single output like positive, negative or neutral.

### 4. Many-to-Many RNN
The Many-to-Many RNN type processes a sequence of inputs and generates a sequence of outputs. In language translation task a sequence of words in one language is given as input, and a corresponding sequence in another language is generated as output.

## Variants of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Vanilla RNN
- Bidirectional RNNs
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
### 1. Vanilla RNN
This simplest form of RNN consists of a single hidden layer where weights are shared across time steps. Vanilla RNNs are suitable for learning short-term dependencies but are limited by the vanishing gradient problem, which hampers long-sequence learning.

### 2. Bidirectional RNNs
Bidirectional RNNs process inputs in both forward and backward directions, capturing both past and future context for each time step. This architecture is ideal for tasks where the entire sequence is available, such as named entity recognition and question answering.

### 3. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) introduce a memory mechanism to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. Each LSTM cell has three gates:

- **Input Gate :** Controls how much new information should be added to the cell state.
- **Forget Gate :** Decides what past information should be discarded.
- **Output Gate :** Regulates what information should be output at the current step. This selective memory enables LSTMs to handle long-term dependencies, making them ideal for tasks where earlier context is critical.

### 4. Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
 Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) simplify LSTMs by combining the input and forget gates into a single update gate and streamlining the output mechanism. This design is computationally efficient, often performing similarly to LSTMs, and is useful in tasks where simplicity and faster training are beneficial.

## Advantages of Recurrent Neural Networks

- **Sequential Memory :** RNNs retain information from previous inputs, making them ideal for time-series predictions where past data is crucial. This capability is often called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
- **Enhanced Pixel Neighborhoods :** RNNs can be combined with convolutional layers to capture extended pixel neighborhoods improving performance in image and video data processing.

## Limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

While RNNs excel at handling sequential data, they face two main training challenges
- Vanishing Gradient Problem
- Exploding Gradient Problem
	1. **Vanishing Gradient :** During backpropagation, gradients diminish as they pass through each time step, leading to minimal weight updates. This limits the RNN’s ability to learn long-term dependencies, which is crucial for tasks like language translation.
	2. **Exploding Gradient :** Sometimes, gradients grow uncontrollably, causing excessively large weight updates that destabilize training. Gradient clipping is a common technique to manage this issue.

## Applications of Recurrent Neural Networks

RNNs are used in various applications where data is sequential or time-based:

- **Time-Series Prediction :** RNNs excel in forecasting tasks, such as stock market predictions and weather forecasting.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) :** RNNs are fundamental in NLP tasks like language modeling, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
- **Speech Recognition :** RNNs capture temporal patterns in speech data, aiding in speech-to-text and other audio-related applications.
- **Image and Video Processing :** When combined with convolutional layers, RNNs help analyze video sequences, facial expressions, and gesture recognition.
