## Recurrent Neural Network

In neural network the information flows in one direction from input to output. However in RNN information is fed back into the system after each step. 

RNNs allow the network to "remember" past information by feeding the output from one step into next step. This helps the network understand the context of what has already happened and make better predictions based on that.Â For example when predicting the next word in a sentence the RNN uses the previous words to help decide what word is most likely to come next.
