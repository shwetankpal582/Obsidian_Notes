**Reinforcement Learning** is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment** to achieve a **goal**.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Elements

1. **Agent**  
    The decision-maker (e.g., a robot or software).
    
2. **Environment**  
    The world the agent interacts with (e.g., a game, a real-world system).
    
3. **State (S)**  
    A representation of the current situation.
    
4. **Action (A)**  
    Choices the agent can make.
    
5. **Reward (R)**  
    Feedback from the environment after each action (positive or negative).
    
6. **Policy (Ï€)**  
    The agent's strategy â€” a mapping from states to actions.
    
7. **Value Function**  
    Predicts future rewards from a given state (used to evaluate how good a state is).

### ðŸ”¹ How It Works (Feedback Loop)

1. Agent observes **state**.
    
2. Agent takes an **action**.
    
3. Environment returns a **reward** and a new **state**.
    
4. Agent updates its **policy** based on the reward.
    
5. Repeat until the agent learns the best strategy (maximizing total reward).

### ðŸ”¹ Example

**Game playing (e.g., chess, Atari):**  
The agent tries different moves, learns from wins/losses, and improves over time.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Reinforcement Learning

- **Model-Free RL:** Learns directly from experience (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks).
    
- **Model-Based RL:** Builds a model of the environment to plan ahead.
