Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to **learn patterns from data** and **make decisions or predictions** without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing rules, you feed the machine **data + expected output**, and it learns the logic (model) by itself.

### üì¶ **Types of Machine Learning**

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Supervised Learning**|Learns from labeled data (input + output).|Spam detection, house price prediction|
|**Unsupervised Learning**|Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.|Customer segmentation, topic modeling|
|**Reinforcement Learning**|Learns by trial-and-error via rewards/punishments from an environment.|Self-driving cars, game bots|

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Components**

- **Data**: Input information (numbers, images, text, etc.)
    
- **Model**: A mathematical structure that makes predictions.
    
- **Algorithm**: The process for learning from data (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).
    
- **Training**: Feeding data into the algorithm to learn a model.
    
- **Testing**: Evaluating the model on new (unseen) data.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges in ML**

- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes data instead of generalizing.
    
- **Underfitting**: Model too simple to capture data patterns.
    
- **Bias in Data**: Leads to unfair or inaccurate predictions.
    
- **Need for Large Data**: Performance improves with more data.
