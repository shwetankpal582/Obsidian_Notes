The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that
develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human brain that has neurons
interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are
interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known
as nodes.

## Components of ANN

Neurons
Layers
Connection
Activation Function


**Neuron**
A **neuron**, also called a **node** or **unit**, is the fundamental processing element of an ANN. It receives inputs, processes them using weights and bias, applies an activation function, and produces an output.



**Layers**
Layers are organized groups of neurons. An ANN is composed of:

**Input Layer:** Takes input features.
**Hidden Layer(s):** Intermediate layers that perform computations.
**Output Layer:** Produces the final result.
	**Purpose:**  
	    Layers help in learning complex patterns from data.

**Connection**
Connections are **links** between neurons of one layer to the next. Each connection has an associated **weight** that determines the strength of the signal.

- **Types of Connection**
- **Feedforward:** Signals move in one direction.
- **Feedback/Recurrent:** Loops may exist.

**Activation Function**
A function applied to a neuron's weighted input to introduce **non-linearity** and decide whether the neuron should activate.
