**Object Detection** is the task of identifying and localizing objects within an image â€” it combines **classification** (what) and **localization** (where).

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components:

1. **Classification** â€“ What is in the image?
    
2. **Localization** â€“ Where is the object? (bounding boxes)

### ðŸ”¹ Categories of Deep Learning Object Detection Models

#### 1. **Two-Stage Detectors**

These models first generate **region proposals**, then classify them.

- **R-CNN (Region-CNN)**  
    Extracts region proposals, uses CNN to classify them.
    
- **Fast R-CNN**  
    Improves R-CNN by running CNN over the entire image once.
    
- **Faster R-CNN**  
    Adds a **Region Proposal Network (RPN)** to generate proposals quickly.
    

ðŸŸ© **Pros:** High accuracy  
ðŸŸ¥ **Cons:** Slower inference

#### 2. **Single-Stage Detectors**

These models detect and classify objects in one go.

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  
    Divides image into grids, predicts bounding boxes and classes directly.
    
- **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)**  
    Detects objects at multiple scales using feature maps from different layers.
    

ðŸŸ© **Pros:** Very fast  
ðŸŸ¥ **Cons:** Slightly lower accuracy than two-stage

### ðŸ”¹ Other Notable Techniques

- **RetinaNet**  
    Combines single-shot detection with **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance.
    
- **EfficientDet**  
    Optimized for both speed and accuracy using compound scaling.

### ðŸ”¹ Steps in Deep Learning-Based Object Detection

1. **Input image**
    
2. **Backbone CNN** (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet) extracts features
    
3. **Region proposal / anchor generation**
    
4. **Classification + Bounding Box Regression**
    
5. **Post-processing (Non-Max Suppression)**
