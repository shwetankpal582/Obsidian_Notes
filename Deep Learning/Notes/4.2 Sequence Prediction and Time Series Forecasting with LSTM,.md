**LSTM** is a type of **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** specially designed to handle **sequential data** and remember long-term dependencies. Itâ€™s ideal for **time series forecasting**, such as stock prices, weather, or sensor data.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **What is Sequence Prediction?**

It involves predicting the **next element** in a sequence based on previous elements.  
Example:  
Given `[10, 20, 30] â†’ predict 40`

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **What is Time Series Forecasting?**

A type of sequence prediction where data points are **indexed over time**, often at regular intervals.  
Goal: Predict **future values** based on historical trends.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Why Use LSTM?**

Traditional neural networks fail at learning **temporal relationships**.  
LSTM overcomes this with **memory cells** and **gates** that control the flow of information:

- **Forget Gate**: Decides what to discard from memory
    
- **Input Gate**: Decides what new information to store
    
- **Output Gate**: Decides what to output
