In **deep learning (DL)**, a **loss function** is a mathematical function used to evaluate how well a model’s predictions match the actual target values. It measures the "error" or "cost" during training and guides the learning process by adjusting the model’s weights via **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**.

### 💡 Why is it important?

The loss function tells the model how far off it is from the desired output. Lower loss = better performance (generally).

## 🔹 Common Types of Loss Functions

### **1. Regression Tasks**

Used when the output is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices):

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
    
    MSE=1n∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2MSE=n1​i=1∑n​(yi​−y^​i​)2
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
    
    MAE=1n∑i=1n∣yi−y^i∣\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|MAE=n1​i=1∑n​∣yi​−y^​i​∣

### **2. Classification Tasks**

Used when the output is categorical (e.g., spam vs not spam):

- **Binary Cross-Entropy** (for binary classification):
    
    L=−1n∑i=1n[yilog⁡(y^i)+(1−yi)log⁡(1−y^i)]L = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]L=−n1​i=1∑n​[yi​log(y^​i​)+(1−yi​)log(1−y^​i​)]
- **Categorical Cross-Entropy** (for multi-class classification):
    
    L=−∑iyilog⁡(y^i)L = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)L=−i∑​yi​log(y^​i​)
- **Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy**: Like categorical cross-entropy but for integer-labeled classes.

## 🔹 Custom Loss Functions

You can define your own loss function if standard ones don't fit your problem. In frameworks like **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**, it's easy to create them using basic operations.

## 🔹 Choosing the Right Loss Function

- **Task type**: regression vs classification
    
- **Distribution of data**: Are there outliers? Use MAE instead of MSE.
    
- **Balance of classes**: For imbalanced data, use **weighted** or **focal loss**.
