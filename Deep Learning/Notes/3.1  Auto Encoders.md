An autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture used in Deep Learning for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction tasks. It is primarily designed to learn efficient representations of data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional laten space and then decoding it back to the original data space. Autoencoders are widely used to various applications, including data compression, denoising, feature learning, and anamoly detection.
