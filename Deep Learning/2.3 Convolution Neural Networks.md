CNN (Convolution Neural Networks)
	They are specially designed to work with images. In DL images are represented as arrays of pixel values.

**There are 4 Layers of CNN**

- Convolutional Layer
- ReLU
- Pooling Layers
- Fully connected (dense) Layers


**Operation on CNN**

- Convolution Operation
- Pooling Operation
- Flatten Operation
- Classification Operation

Convolutional Layer and convolution operation
This is first layer in CNN. It takes images as input and begins to process
	**There are 3 main elements in convolutional layer**
		Input Image
		Filters / Kernal
		Feature Map / Convoluted Map
