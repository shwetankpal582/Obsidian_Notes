# Types of Transmission mode:
### 1. Simplex Mode:
- In Simplex mode, *the communication is unidirectional,* as on a one-way street.
- Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. 
- The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.
- **Example**: Keyboard and traditional monitor

### 2. Half Duplex Mode:
- Each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. 
- When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa. 
- The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction.
- **Example**: Walkie-talkie in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both directions.

Channel capacity=Bandwidth * Propagation Delay
