# Types of Transmission mode:
### 1. Simplex Mode:
- In Simplex mode, *the communication is unidirectional,* as on a one-way street.
- Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. 
- The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.
- **Example**: Keyboard and traditional monitor
