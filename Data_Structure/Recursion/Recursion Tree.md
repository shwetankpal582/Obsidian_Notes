# What is recursion tree ?
A recursion tree is a graphical representation that illustrates the execution flow of a recursive function.
It provides a visual breakdown of recursive calls, showcasing the progression of the algorithm as it branches out and eventually reaches a base case. 
The tree structure helps in analyzing the time complexity and understanding the recursive process involved.

### Tree structure
Each node in a recursion tree represents a particular recursive call. 
The initial call is depicted at the top, with subsequent calls branching out beneath it.
The tree grows downward, forming a hierarchical structure. The branching factor of each node depends on the number of recursive calls made within the function. Additionally, the depth of the tree corresponds to the number of recursive calls before reaching the base case.
