# What is recursion?
**Recursion** is defined as a process which calls itself directly or indirectly and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

**Example**: A simple example of recursion of *factorial of a number function*.

### Types of Recursion:

1. **Direct recursion:** When a function is called within itself directly it is called direct recursion. This can be further categorised into four types: 
    - Tail recursion,  
    - Head recursion,  
    - Tree recursion and 
    - Nested recursion.
2. **Indirect recursion:** Indirect recursion occurs when a function calls another function that eventually calls the original function and it forms a cycle.
