# What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying **different options** and **unbdoing** them if they lead to a **dead end**. It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore multiple possibilities to solve a problem, like searching for a path in a maze or solving puzzles like Sudoku.
Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.
### Basic Terminologies

- **Candidate:** A candidate is a potential choice or element that can be added to the current solution.
- **Solution:** The solution is a valid and complete configuration that satisfies all problem constraints.
- **Partial Solution:** A partial solution is an intermediate or incomplete configuration being constructed during the backtracking process.
- **Decision Space:** The decision space is the set of all possible candidates or choices at each decision point.
- **Decision Point:** A decision point is a specific step in the algorithm where a candidate is chosen and added to the partial solution.
- **Feasible Solution:** A feasible solution is a partial or complete solution that adheres to all constraints.
- **Dead End:** A dead end occurs when a partial solution cannot be extended without violating constraints.
- **Backtrack:** Backtracking involves undoing previous decisions and returning to a prior decision point.
- **Search Space:** The search space includes all possible combinations of candidates and choices.
- **Optimal Solution:** In optimization problems, the optimal solution is the best possible solution.
