# Visualize Recursion 
To visualize recursion tree, we can do two things
1. **Recursion Tree:**
	- Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics that allows functions to call themselves, enabling the solution of complex problems through iterative steps. One visual representation commonly used to understand and analyze the execution of recursive functions is a recursion tree.
	- A recursion tree is a graphical representation that illustrates the execution flow of a recursive function. It provides a visual breakdown of recursive calls, showcasing the progression of the algorithm as it branches out and eventually reaches a base case. The tree structure helps in analyzing the time complexity and understanding the recursive process involved.
