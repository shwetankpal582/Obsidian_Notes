# Why constant Time for accessing Array elements?
- [] To access an array element, *the address of an element is computed* as an offset from the base address of the array and one multiplication is needed to compute what is supposed to be added to the base address to get the memory address of the element. *First the size of an element of that data type is calculated and then it is multiplied with the index of the element to get the value to be added to the base address.*
This process takes one multiplication and one addition. Since these two operations take constant time, we can say the array access can be performed in constant time.

### Advantages of Arrays
- Simple and easy to use
