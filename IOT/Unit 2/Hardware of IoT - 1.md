## Sensors
**Sensors** are used for sensing things and devices etc.
A device that provides a usable output in response to a specified measurement.  
The sensor attains a physical parameter and converts it into a signal suitable for processing (e.g. electrical, mechanical, optical) the characteristics of any device or material to detect the presence of a particular physical quantity.  
The output of the sensor is a signal which is converted to a human-readable form like changes in characteristics, changes in resistance, capacitance, impedance, etc.

## Digital Sensors

Unlike analog sensor, **Digital Sensor** produce discrete values (0 and 1’s). Discrete values often called digital or binary signals in digital communication.

Electronic sensors or electrochemical sensors in which data conversion and data transmission take place digitally are digital sensors. These digital sensors are replacing analog sensors as they are capable of overcoming the drawbacks of analog sensors. The digital sensor consists of majorly three components such as senor, cable, and transmitter. But, In digital sensors, the signal measured directly converted into digital signal output inside the digital sensor itself. So, this digital signal transmitted through cable digitally. There are different types of digital sensors that overcome the disadvantages of analog sensors.
