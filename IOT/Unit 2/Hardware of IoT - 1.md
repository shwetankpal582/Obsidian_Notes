## Sensors
**Sensors**Â are used for sensing things and devices etc.
A device that provides a usable output in response to a specified measurement.  
The sensor attains a physical parameter and converts it into a signal suitable for processing (e.g. electrical, mechanical, optical) the characteristics of any device or material to detect the presence of a particular physical quantity.  
The output of the sensor is a signal which is converted to a human-readable form like changes in characteristics, changes in resistance, capacitance, impedance, etc.
