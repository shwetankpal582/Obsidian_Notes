# Wireless sensor networks
**Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**, is an infrastructure-less wireless network that is deployed in a large number of wireless sensors in an ad-hoc manner that is used to monitor the system, physical, or environmental conditions. 

Sensor nodes are used in WSN with the onboard processor that manages and monitors the environment in a particular area. They are connected to the Base Station which acts as a processing unit in the WSN System. The base Station in a WSN System is connected through the Internet to share data. WSN can be used for processing, analysis, storage, and mining of the data.

## Participatory Sensing Technology

**Participatory Sensing -** *Participatory sensing is the process whereby individuals and communities use ever- more-capable mobile phones and cloud services to collect and analyze systematic data for use in discovery.* The convergence of technology and analytical innovation with a citizenry that is increasingly comfortable using mobile phones and online social networking sets the stage for this technology to dramatically impact many aspects of our daily lives.
### 1.  Applications and Usage Models
- *One application of participatory sensing is as a tool for health and wellness.* For example, individuals can self-monitor to observe and adjust their medication, physical activity, nutrition, and interactions. Potential contexts include chronic-disease management and health behavior change. Communities and health professionals can also use participatory approaches to better understand the development and effective treatment of disease.
- The same systems *can be used as tools for sustainability*. For example, individuals and communities can explore their transportation and consumption habits, and corporations can promote more sustainable practices among employees.
- In addition, participatory sensing offers a powerful “make a case” technique to support advocacy and civic engagement. *It can provide a framework in which citizens can bring to light a civic bottleneck, hazard, personal-safety concern, cultural asset, or other data relevant to urban and natural-resources planning and services, all using data that are systematic and can be validated.*
- These different applications imply several different usage models. These models range from public contribution, in which individuals collect data in response to inquiries defined by others, to personal use and reflection, in which individuals log information about themselves and use the results for personal analysis and behavior change. Yet across these varied applications and usage models, a common workflow is emerging,

### 2.  Essential Components

- **Ubiquitous Data Capture** - While empirical data can be collected in a variety of ways, mobile phones are a special and, perhaps, unprecedented tool for the job. These devices have become mobile computing, sensing, and communication platforms, complete with image, audio, video, motion, proximity, and location data capture and broadband communication, and they are capable of being programmed for manual, automatic, and con-text-aware data capture.

- **Leveraged Data Processing and Management** -  Because of the sheer ubiquity of mobile phones and associated communication infrastructure, it is possible to include people of all backgrounds nearly everywhere in the world. Because these devices travel with us, they can help us make sustainable observations on an intimately personal level. Collectively, they provide unmatched coverage in space and time.

- In some cases, the data collected with a mobile device are enough to reveal an interesting pattern on their own. However, when processed through a series of external and cross-user data sources, models, and algorithms, simple data can be used to infer complex phenomena about individuals and groups. Mapping and other interactive capabilities of today's Web enhance the presentation and interpretation of these patterns for participants. Many applications will call for the comparison of current measures to past trends, so robust and long term storage and management of this data is a central requirement.
