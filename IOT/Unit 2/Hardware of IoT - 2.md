# Wireless sensor networks
**Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**, is an infrastructure-less wireless network that is deployed in a large number of wireless sensors in an ad-hoc manner that is used to monitor the system, physical, or environmental conditions. 

Sensor nodes are used in WSN with the onboard processor that manages and monitors the environment in a particular area. They are connected to the Base Station which acts as a processing unit in the WSN System. The base Station in a WSN System is connected through the Internet to share data. WSN can be used for processing, analysis, storage, and mining of the data.

## Participatory Sensing Technology

**Participatory Sensing -** *Participatory sensing is the process whereby individuals and communities use ever- more-capable mobile phones and cloud services to collect and analyze systematic data for use in discovery.* The convergence of technology and analytical innovation with a citizenry that is increasingly comfortable using mobile phones and online social networking sets the stage for this technology to dramatically impact many aspects of our daily lives.
### 1.  Applications and Usage Models
- *One application of participatory sensing is as a tool for health and wellness.* For example, individuals can self-monitor to observe and adjust their medication, physical activity, nutrition, and interactions. Potential contexts include chronic-disease management and health behavior change. Communities and health professionals can also use participatory approaches to better understand the development and effective treatment of disease.
- The same systems *can be used as tools for sustainability*. For example, individuals and communities can explore their transportation and consumption habits, and corporations can promote more sustainable practices among employees.
- In addition, participatory sensing offers a powerful “make a case” technique to support advocacy and civic engagement. *It can provide a framework in which citizens can bring to light a civic bottleneck, hazard, personal-safety concern, cultural asset, or other data relevant to urban and natural-resources planning and services, all using data that are systematic and can be validated.*
- These different applications imply several different usage models. These models range from public contribution, in which individuals collect data in response to inquiries defined by others, to personal use and reflection, in which individuals log information about themselves and use the results for personal analysis and behavior change. Yet across these varied applications and usage models, a common workflow is emerging,
