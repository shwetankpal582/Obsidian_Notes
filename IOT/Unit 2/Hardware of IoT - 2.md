# Wireless sensor networks
**Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**, is an infrastructure-less wireless network that is deployed in a large number of wireless sensors in an ad-hoc manner that is used to monitor the system, physical, or environmental conditions. 

Sensor nodes are used in WSN with the onboard processor that manages and monitors the environment in a particular area. They are connected to the Base Station which acts as a processing unit in the WSN System. The base Station in a WSN System is connected through the Internet to share data. WSN can be used for processing, analysis, storage, and mining of the data.
