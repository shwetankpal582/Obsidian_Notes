# Wireless sensor networks
**Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**, is an infrastructure-less wireless network that is deployed in a large number of wireless sensors in an ad-hoc manner that is used to monitor the system, physical, or environmental conditions. 

Sensor nodes are used in WSN with the onboard processor that manages and monitors the environment in a particular area. They are connected to the Base Station which acts as a processing unit in the WSN System. The base Station in a WSN System is connected through the Internet to share data. WSN can be used for processing, analysis, storage, and mining of the data.

## Participatory Sensing Technology

**Participatory Sensing -** *Participatory sensing is the process whereby individuals and communities use ever- more-capable mobile phones and cloud services to collect and analyze systematic data for use in discovery.* The convergence of technology and analytical innovation with a citizenry that is increasingly comfortable using mobile phones and online social networking sets the stage for this technology to dramatically impact many aspects of our daily lives.
