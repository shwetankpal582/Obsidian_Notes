# Wireless sensor networks
**Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**, is an infrastructure-less wireless network that is deployed in a large number of wireless sensors in an ad-hoc manner that is used to monitor the system, physical, or environmental conditions. 

Sensor nodes are used in WSN with the onboard processor that manages and monitors the environment in a particular area. They are connected to the Base Station which acts as a processing unit in the WSN System. The base Station in a WSN System is connected through the Internet to share data. WSN can be used for processing, analysis, storage, and mining of the data.

## Participatory Sensing Technology

**Participatory Sensing -** *Participatory sensing is the process whereby individuals and communities use ever- more-capable mobile phones and cloud services to collect and analyze systematic data for use in discovery.* The convergence of technology and analytical innovation with a citizenry that is increasingly comfortable using mobile phones and online social networking sets the stage for this technology to dramatically impact many aspects of our daily lives.
### 1.  Applications and Usage Models
- *One application of participatory sensing is as a tool for health and wellness.* For example, individuals can self-monitor to observe and adjust their medication, physical activity, nutrition, and interactions. Potential contexts include chronic-disease management and health behavior change. Communities and health professionals can also use participatory approaches to better understand the development and effective treatment of disease.
- The same systems *can be used as tools for sustainability*. For example, individuals and communities can explore their transportation and consumption habits, and corporations can promote more sustainable practices among employees.
- In addition, participatory sensing offers a powerful “make a case” technique to support advocacy and civic engagement. It can provide a framework in which citizens can bring to light a civic bottleneck, hazard, personal-safety concern, cultural asset, or other data relevant to urban and natural-resources planning and services, all using data that are systematic and can be validated.
