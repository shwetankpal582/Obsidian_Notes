# M2M communication
M2M (Machine to Machine) is a concept that enables networked devices to perform actions by exchange information without the manual assistance of humans.

Machine to Machine refers to direct communication between devices using wired or wireless communications channel.
### **Key Components for M2M System:**
Key components of an M2M system include
- Sensors,
- RFID,
- a Wi-Fi or cellular communications link and
- To help a networked device to interpret data and make decisions, the need for Autonomic Computing software programmed.

Machine to machine communication can include industrial instrumentation,
- Enabling a sensor to communicate the data it records (such asÂ temperature, inventory level, etc.) to application software.
- This application software can use it (for example, adjusting an industrial process based on temperature or placing orders to replenish inventory).
