### IoT/M2M systems
- Designing a communication framework from connecting devices, for their local area networking and provisions for data gathering.
- Designing a data enrichment, data consolidation and data transformation framework.
- Designing gateway components for connecting the device's network with the web/Internet.
- Need of application and applications-support frameworks for services, applications and processes.

## Design Standardization
- *Internet Engineering Task Force* (IETF), an international body initiated actions for addressing and working on the recommendations for the engineering specifications for the internet of Things.
- IETF suggests the specification for the layers, and the engineering aspects for the IoT communication, networks and applications.

> - OGC

### ITU-T
- *International Telecommunication Union for Telecommunication*
- It suggested a reference model for IoT domain, network and transport capabilities for the IoT services and the applications at the application and application-support layers.

### ETSI
- *European Telecommunication Standards Institute* initiated the development of set of standards for the network, and devices and gateway domains for the communication between machines (M2M). ETSI proposed high-level architecture for applications and service capabilities.
### OGC 
- Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), an international Industry Consortium, has also suggested open standards for sensors' discovery, capabilities, quality and other aspects with support to geographical information web support.

## Communication Technology
**IoT Communication:** IoT is the connection of devices over the internet, where these smart devices communicate with each other , exchange data , perform some tasks without any human involvement. These devices are embedded with electronics, software, network and sensors which help in communication. Communication between smart devices is very important in IOT as it  enables these devices to gather, exchange data which contribute in success of that IOT product/project.

#### Types of Communication Technology:
1. **Human to Machine(H2M)[[Types of Communications in IOT - GeeksforGeeks#^b58da5|go]]**
2. **Machine to Machine(M2M)**
3. **Machine to Human(M2H)**
4. **Human to Human(H2H)**
