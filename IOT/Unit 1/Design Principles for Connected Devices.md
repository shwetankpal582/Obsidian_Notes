### IoT/M2M systems
- Designing a communication framework from connecting devices, for their local area networking and provisions for data gathering.
- Designing a data enrichment, data consolidation and data transformation framework.
- Designing gateway components for connecting the device's network with the web/Internet.
- Need of application and applications-support frameworks for services, applications and processes.

## Design Standardisation
- *Internet Engineering Task Force* (IETF), an international body initiated actions for addressing and working on the recommendations for the engineering specifications for the internet of Things.
- IETF suggests the specification for the layers, and the engineering aspects for the IoT communication, networks and applications.

### ITU-T
- *International Telecommunication Union for Telecommunication*
- It suggested a reference model for IoT domain, network and transport capabilities for the IoT services and the applications at the application and application-support layers.
