## What is Data Enrichment?
*The practice of adding more information to raw data to make it more complete and thorough is known as data enrichment.*
It entails enhancing accuracy, adding pertinent features, and closing gaps to increase the data's analytical value. Through this process, simple knowledge is transformed into a rich resource that may provide greater understanding. 
It may assist you in improved decision-making, process optimization, product improvement, and consumer understanding. But raw data on its own is insufficient. To make your data more relevant and helpful, you must add more details and insights to it.

*The goal of data enrichment is to enhance your data with more context and details so that you can get a deeper understanding of your customers, markets, trends, and opportunities*. Data enrichment can help you answer more questions, generate more insights, and create more value from your data.
