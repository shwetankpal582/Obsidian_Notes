- Data is vulnerable **during transmission and storage**, risking breaches and misuse.
    

---

### 3. **Lack of Standardized Security Protocols**

- No universal security standards across IoT devices.
    
- Devices from different vendors may use **inconsistent or outdated encryption and communication protocols**.
    

---

### 4. **Insecure Communication**

- Many devices use **unsecured channels** (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS).
    
- This allows attackers to perform **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attacks to intercept or modify data.
    

---

### 5. **Firmware Vulnerabilities**

- **Outdated or unpatched firmware** is a major security risk.
    
- Many devices **do not support over-the-air (OTA) updates**, or updates are infrequent and insecure.
    

---

### 6. **Botnets and DDoS Attacks**

- Compromised IoT devices are often used in **botnets** (e.g., Mirai) to launch **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks.
    
- Large-scale attacks can take down websites and networks.
    

---

### 7. **Physical Security Threats**

- IoT devices are often deployed in **public or remote locations** where physical tampering is possible.
    
- Attackers can access ports or reset devices to gain control.
    

---

### 8. **Lack of End-to-End Security**

- Security is often implemented only in **specific layers** (e.g., app or network), but **end-to-end security** (device to cloud) is lacking.
    

---

### 9. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**

- Devices may be **pre-infected with malware** during manufacturing or shipping.
    
- Components from **untrusted suppliers** can introduce backdoors or weaknesses.
