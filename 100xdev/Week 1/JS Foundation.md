## Variables (let, var, const)
## Data Types (strings, numbers and booleans)
## Loops  (If else, For)


### Variables

**1. Var** 

 It has the [Global scoped](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-variable-scopes-in-javascript/#:~:text=types%20of%20scopes-,Global%20Scope,-%E2%80%93%20Scope%20outside%20the) or function scoped. This means:

- If you create a variable outside of a function, you can use it anywhere in your code.
- If you create a variable inside a function, you can only use it within that function.

```
var a = 10;
console.log(a);
```
