# Introduction
IoT stands for Internet of Things. *It refers to the interconnectedness of physical devices, such as appliances and vehicles, that are embedded with software, sensors, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data*. This technology allows for the collection and sharing of data from a vast network of devices, creating opportunities for more efficient and automated systems.

**Internet of Things (IoT)**Â is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment.

## Vision Of IoT
The former(old Gen) gives it a network-oriented vision whereas the latter one pushes it towards objects which are combined to get settled in a single architecture. 
IoT signifies "world-wide network of interconnected objects uniquely addressable based on standard communication protocols".
The Three Visions of IoT are : 
1. **Things Oriented Vision**
	- In this vision, *objects are tracked by sensors and technologies using RFID(Radio Frequency Identification).* The data is collected through sensors and sensor  based embedded system. This vision depends on RFID-based sensor networks and other sensor-based networks which integrate technologies based on RFID, sensing, computing devices and the global connectivity.
2. **Internet Oriented Vision**
	- The internet-oriented vision *sees the various physical devices interacting with each other.* The sensor-based objects can be determined uniquely and their whereabouts can be regularly monitored. These smart embedded objects can be considered as microcomputers which computing resources.
3. **Semantic Oriented Vision**
	- *This vision states that the data collected through sensors will be huge. Thus, the collected data is processed effectively*. The raw data is processed in order to make it consistent and least redundant which is useful for better representations and interpretation.

## Iot Architecture
The IoT associates trillions of objects or devices which will generate a lot of traffic and to handle that huge data storage will be needed.
The issues like security and privacy also needs to be ensured when proposing the new architecture for IoT addressing scalability, interoperability, reliability, QoS etc
The primitive architecture of IOT is :

1. **Sensing layer:** This is the first layer of architecture which is responsible for collecting data from different sources. This layer contains sensor and actuator which is responsible for collecting information about temperature, humidity, light, sound, and other physical parameters. Wired or wireless communication protocols connect these devices to the network layer.
2. **Network layer:** The network layer of an IoT architecture is responsible for providing communication and connectivity between devices in the IoT system. It includes protocols and technologies that enable devices to connect and communicate with each other and with the wider internet. Example: Wifi, bluetooth, cellular networks such as 4G and 5G technology. 
3. **Data processing Layer:** The data processing layer of IoT architecture refers to the software and hardware components that are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from IoT devices. This layer is responsible for receiving raw data from the devices, processing it, and making it available for further analysis or action. The data processing layer includes a variety of technologies and tools, such as data management systems, analytics platforms, and machine learning algorithems.
4. **Application layer:** The application layer of IoT architecture is the topmost layer that interacts directly with the end-user. It is responsible for providing user-friendly interfaces and functionalities that enable users to access and control IoT devices. This layer includes various software and applications such as mobile apps, web portals, and other user interfaces that are designed to interact with the underlying IoT infrastructure.
