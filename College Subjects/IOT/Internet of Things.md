# Introduction
IoT stands for Internet of Things. *It refers to the interconnectedness of physical devices, such as appliances and vehicles, that are embedded with software, sensors, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data*. This technology allows for the collection and sharing of data from a vast network of devices, creating opportunities for more efficient and automated systems.

**Internet of Things (IoT)**Â is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment.

### Vision Of IoT
The former(old Gen) gives it a network-oriented vision whereas the latter one pushes it towards objects which are combined to get settled in a single architecture. 
IoT signifies "world-wide network of interconnected objects uniquely addressable based on standard communication protocols".
The Three Visions of IoT are : 
1. **Things Oriented Vision**
2. **Internet Oriented Vision**
3. **Semantic Oriented Vision**
