# Introduction
IoT stands for Internet of Things. *It refers to the interconnectedness of physical devices, such as appliances and vehicles, that are embedded with software, sensors, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data*. This technology allows for the collection and sharing of data from a vast network of devices, creating opportunities for more efficient and automated systems.

**Internet of Things (IoT)**Â is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment.

### Vision Of IoT
The former(old Gen) gives it a network-oriented vision whereas the latter one pushes it towards objects which are combined to get settled in a single architecture. 
IoT signifies "world-wide network of interconnected objects uniquely addressable based on standard communication protocols".
The Three Visions of IoT are : 
1. **Things Oriented Vision**
	- In this vision, *objects are tracked by sensors and technologies using RFID(Radio Frequency Identification).* The data is collected through sensors and sensor  based embedded system. This vision depends on RFID-based sensor networks and other sensor-based networks which integrate technologies based on RFID, sensing, computing devices and the global connectivity.
2. **Internet Oriented Vision**
	- The internet-oriented vision *sees the various physical devices interacting with each other.* The sensor-based objects can be determined uniquely and their whereabouts can be regularly monitored. These smart embedded objects can be considered as microcomputers which computing resources.
3. **Semantic Oriented Vision**
	- *This vision states that the data collected through sensors will be huge. Thus, the collected data is processed effectively*. The raw data is processed in order to make it consistent and least redundant which is useful for better representations and interpretation.
