# What is Memory managemet?
In a multiprogramming computer, the Operating System resides in a part of memory, and the rest is used by multiple processes.  The task of subdividing the memory among different processes is called Memory Management. 
*Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution*. The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient utilization of memory.

## Why memory management is required?
- Allocate and de-allocate memory before and after process execution.
- To keep track of used memory space by processes.
- To minimize fragmentation issues.
- To proper utilization of main memory.
- To maintain data integrity while executing of process.


# Logical Vs Physical Address
## What is logical Address?
- A logical address, also known as a virtual address, *is an address generated by the CPU during program execution.*
-  It is the address seen by the process and is relative to the program’s address space. The process accesses memory using logical address, which are translated by the operating system into physical addresses. *An address that is created by the CPU while a program is running is known as a logical address.*
- Because the logical address is virtual - that is, it doesn't exist physically.
- The CPU uses this address as a reference to go to the actual memory location .
- The term Logical address space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program's prespective.
## What is a physical address?
- A logical address is the actual address in the main memory where data is stored. It is a location in physical memory, as opposed to a virtual address.
- MMU(Memory Management Unit ) is used for translating logical address to physical address.
- The user must used the corresponding logical address to go to the physical address rather than directly accessing the physical address.
 - @ Physical address is the precise position of data.

### Similarities between Logical and Physical Address:-
- Both logical and physical addresses are used to *identify a specific location in memory*.
- Both logical and physical addresses can be represented in *different formats, such as binary, hexadecimal, or decimal*.
- Both logical and physical addresses have *a finite range, which is determined by the number of bits used to represent them.*
## Difference Between Logical address and Physical Address

| **Address Space** | Logical Address Space is set of all logical addresses generated by CPU in reference to a program. | Physical Address is set of all physical addresses mapped to the corresponding logical addresses. |
| **Visibility**    | User can view the logical address of a program.                                                   | User can never view physical address of program.                                                 |

| **Access**        | The user can use the logical address to access the physical address.                              | The user can indirectly access physical address but not directly.                                |

# Swapping:

- Swapping in an OS is process that moves data or program between the computer's main memory (RAM) and secondary storage(SSD or HD). 
- Helps in managing the limited space of RAM and allows the system to run more programs than it could otherwise handle simultaneously.
- ! It is only used when data isn't available in RAM. Although the swapping process degrades system performance, it allows larger and multiple processes to run concurrently. 
- Because of this, swapping is also known as memory compaction.

### Process of Swapping:
- when the RAM is full and a new program needs to run, the OS selects a program or data that is currently in RAM but not actively being used.
- The selected data is moved to the secondary storage, making space in RAM for the new program.
- When the swapped-out program is needed again, it can be swapped back into RAM, replacing another inactive program or data if necessary.

# Contiguous Memory Allocation:

- Contiguous memory allocation is a memory allocation strategy. 
- Technique to assign contiguous blocks of memory to each task. Thus, whenever a process asks to access the main memory, we allocate a continuous segment from the empty region to the process based on its size. 
- In this technique, memory is allotted in a continuous way to the processes. 
- Contiguous Memory Management has two types:
	- *Fixed(or Static) Partition*
	- *Variable(or Dynamic) Partitioning*

### Types of contiguous memory allocation:
1. **Fixed Partition Scheme**
	- Memory is divided into fixed number of partitions.
	- fixed means number of partitions are fixed in the memory.
	- In every partition only one process will be accommodated.
	- Degree of multi-programming is restricted by number of partitions in the memory. Maximum size of the process is restricted by maximum size of the partition. Every partition is associated with the limit registers.
		- **Limit Registers:** It has two limit:
		- **Lower Limit:** Starting address of the partition.
		- **Upper Limit:** Ending address of the partition.

2. **Variable Partition Scheme:**
- Initially memory will be single continuous free block. whenever the request by the process arrives, accordingly partition will be made in the memory.
- If the smaller processes keep on coming then the larger partitions will be made into smaller partitions.
