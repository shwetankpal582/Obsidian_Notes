# What is Memory managemet?
In a multiprogramming computer, the Operating System resides in a part of memory, and the rest is used by multiple processes.  The task of subdividing the memory among different processes is called Memory Management. 
*Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution*. The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient utilization of memory.

## Why memory management is required?
- Allocate and de-allocate memory before and after process execution.
- To keep track of used memory space by processes.
- To minimize fragmentation issues.
- To proper utilization of main memory.
- To maintain data integrity while executing of process.


# Logical Vs Physical Address
## What is logical Address?
- A logical address, also known as a virtual address, *is an address generated by the CPU during program execution.*
-  It is the address seen by the process and is relative to the program’s address space. The process accesses memory using logical address, which are translated by the operating system into physical addresses. *An address that is created by the CPU while a program is running is known as a logical address.*
- Because the logical address is virtual - that is, it doesn't exist physically.
- The CPU uses this address as a reference to go to the actual memory location .
- The term Logical address space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program's prespective.
## What is a physical address?
- A logical address is the actual address in the main memory where data is stored. It is a location in physical memory, as opposed to a virtual address.
- MMU(Memory Management Unit ) is used for translating logical address to physical address.
- The user must used the corresponding logical address to go to the physical address rather than directly accessing the physical address.
 - @ Physical address is the precise position of data.

### Similarities between Logical and Physical Address:-
- Both logical and physical addresses are used to *identify a specific location in memory*.
- Both logical and physical addresses can be represented in *different formats, such as binary, hexadecimal, or decimal*.
- Both logical and physical addresses have *a finite range, which is determined by the number of bits used to represent them.*
## Difference Between Logical address and Physical Address

| **Basic**         | generated by CPU                                                                                  | location in a memory unit                                                                        |
| **Address Space** | Logical Address Space is set of all logical addresses generated by CPU in reference to a program. | Physical Address is set of all physical addresses mapped to the corresponding logical addresses. |
| **Visibility**    | User can view the logical address of a program.                                                   | User can never view physical address of program.                                                 |
| **Generation**    | generated by the CPU                                                                              | Computed by MMU                                                                                  |
| **Access**        | The user can use the logical address to access the physical address.                              | The user can indirectly access physical address but not directly.                                |
| **Editable**      | Logical address can be change.                                                                    | Physical address will not change.                                                                |
| **Also called**   | virtual address.                                                                                  | real address.                                                                                    |
