**Process Synchronization**Â is used in a computer system to ensure that multiple processes or threads can run concurrently without interfering with each other.

The main objective of process synchronization is to ensure that multiple processes access shared resources without interfering with each other and to prevent the possibility of inconsistent data due to concurrent access. To achieve this, various synchronization techniques such as semaphores, monitors, and critical sections are used.

In a multi-process system, synchronization is necessary to ensure data consistency and integrity, and to avoid the risk of deadlocks and other synchronization problems. Process synchronization is an important aspect of modern operating systems, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring the correct and efficient functioning of multi-process systems.
