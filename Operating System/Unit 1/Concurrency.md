# Concurrency in Operating System
Concurrency in operating systems refers to the capability of an OS to handle more than one task or process at the same time, thereby enhancing efficiency and responsiveness. It may be supported by multi-threading or multi-processing whereby more than one process or threads are executed simultaneously or in an interleaved fashion.

It allows several tasks to be in progress at the same time, either by running on separate processors or through context switching on a single processor.
